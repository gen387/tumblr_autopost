# tumblr_autopost
A simple bot utilizing Selenium and Python for autoposting links on Tumblr. The way it works is a little weird with calling pressing keys, but it was the only way I found consistently working in case of Tumblr

--

Things to install:
- python
- pip3
- chrome with uBlock Origin

Via pip3
- selenium
- pyperclip
- pynput

To avoid bot getting interupted by blue-glass element of Tumblr, I used uBlock with customized filters. They are imported at the beginning.
